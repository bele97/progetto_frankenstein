It was recommended by the novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical fact, affords a point of view to <index indexname="Filosofia" respStmt="AB"><terms>the imagination</terms></index>of the delineating of human passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can yield.I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary principles of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their combinations. The Iliad,the tragic <index indexname="poetry" respStmt="AB"><terms>poetry of Greece</terms></index><name type="person">Shakespeare</name>, in the Tempest and Midsummer Night's Dreamâ€”and most especially, <name type="person">Milton</name>, in <name type="title">Paradise Lost</name>, conform to this rule;
